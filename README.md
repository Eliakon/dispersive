 Data flow controller inspired by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) ORM-ish for the browser


## Install

```sh
npm install dispersive
```

## Create a set of objects

Like an SQL table, a set of objects store entries.
With dispersive, there are 3 different type of actors to manipulate a set of objects: the **schema**, the **model** and the **manager**.
